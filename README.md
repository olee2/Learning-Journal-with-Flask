# Learning Journal with Flask
 Techdegree project #5 - Build a Learning Journal with Flask

This is an exercise in web development using the Python Flask framework. Most of the HTML and all of the CSS was provided by Team Treehouse. The only changes made in the HTML is to make it compatible with my Python code. 

The app is a journal to add, edit and view ones learning experiences.
